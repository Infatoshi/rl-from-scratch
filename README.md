# rl-from-scratch

Before getting into the fun stuff, heres a description about each file purpose
- `real-time-graph.py` is a demo for graphing a function in real time. This is useful for graphing live rewards (better visualization as opposed to reading numbers sequentially).
- `demo.py` lets you feel the simple mechanics of the RL environment we will use. It is a simple grid world where the agent can move up, down, left, right. The agent is rewarded for reaching the goal and penalized for hitting the wall. You will controller this with the arrow keys.
- `main.ipynb` is the main content in the video. Instead of writing about this here, I will explain it in the video and further in the README.md
- `main.py` is the same as main.ipynb but in a python file. This is useful for running the code in a terminal.
